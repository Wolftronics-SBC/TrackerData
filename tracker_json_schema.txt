The JSON files for the tracker take the following structure:

{
    "numFrames": <number of frames in the video>,
    "width": <width of frame>,
    "height": <height of frame>,
    "trackers": [
        {
            "trackerId": <unique ID for this tracker>,
            "birth": <frame that this tracker first appeared>,
            "track": [
                [x, y, frame #],
                [x, y, frame #],
                ...
            ]
        },
        ...
    ]
}

The "trackers" array is sorted by "birth". The "track" array
for a given tracker is sorted by "frame #".


You'll notice that I'm using frame number, instead of absolute timestamp. To
compute the timestamp from the frame number, you need to do the following:

1. Find the timestamp when we recorded the video (e.g. stata1.txt)
2. Find the length of the video.
3. From the two things above, compute the startTimestamp, endTimestamp for
the video
4. Note the numFrames for the tracker JSON file.
5. For a given frame #, approximate the timestamp as follows:

timestamp = startTimestamp + (frame # / numFrames) * (endTimestamp - startTimestamp)
